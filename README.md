MOZ Page Authority and External Link Equity tool for Google Spreadsheets.

[MOZ](http://moz.com/) provides inbound marketing and analytics services, two of wich are [Page Authority](http://moz.com/learn/seo/page-authority) and [External Link Equity](http://moz.com/learn/seo/external-link). This tool will allow you to easily get these two important SEO data points into your Google Spreadsheet. 

## To use this script:

	1. Add this script to your spreadsheet using Tools -> Script Editor menu. 
	2. Fill out the options at the top of the script file.	
	3. Include fully qualified URLs in the first column of your spreadsheet. 
	4. Run the script from the menu. :)

The script will then send your URLs ten at a time to MOZ and get the results. The MOZ free API limits calls to ten at a time ever ten seconds, so if you have a lot of URLs it may take a few minutes to get all the data. MOZ updates these numbers every few weeks so there is no need to update your spreadsheet more often than that.
